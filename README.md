CV-net is a neural network which enables high-precision segmentation of cardiovascular structures in medical CT images.

CV-net is characterized by the following architecture.
  - An encoder and decoder with parallel proccesing lines
  - Piled structures of a normal convolution and depth-wise convolution
  - Convolutions with wide-ranged kernel sizes from 1 to 24
  - Adding self in the final layer before output
  - Skip connections
